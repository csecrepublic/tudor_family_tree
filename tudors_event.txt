Wars of the Roses
1455-1487
The Wars of the Roses were a series of English civil wars fought between the rival houses of Lancaster and York. The social and financial stress following the Hundred Years' War, as well as the physical and monarchical weakness of Henry IV (a Lancaster), caused Richard of York to lay claim to the throne. The Yorks continued to rule England until 1485, when Henry Tudor (allied with the Lancasters) defeated Richard III at the Battle of Bosworth Field. Henry was crowned Henry VII, and his marriage to Elizabeth of York solidified his claim to the monarchy.

English Reformation
1529-1688
The English Reformation was the process by which the Church of England broke away from Catholicism and the authority of the Pope. Riding on the heels of the Protestant Reformation, Henry VIII attempted to divorce his wife, Catherine of Aragon, since she could not produce a male heir. Canon law forbade divorce, and Catherine’s uncle was the Holy Roman Emperor, leaving Pope Clement VII extremely reluctant to annul the marriage. In response, Henry VIII passed the Act of Supremacy, establishing the Church of England with himself as the head. As the monarchy passed through various hands, Catholics and Protestants alike would continue to be persecuted. Friction between the branches culminated in the English Civil War, when the last Catholic king was ousted, cementing the Church of England as a Protestant institution.

Wars of Religion
1522-1648
The Wars of Religion were a series of conflicts throughout Europe following the Protestant Reformation, when various Protestant leaders threatened the hegemony of the Catholic Church. During Henry VIII’s tenure, the dissolution of the monasteries--an assertion of Henry’s power as head of the church--provoked uprisings in the English countryside. In mid-16th-century Scotland, the rhetoric of Calvinist preachers provoked a violent response from the Queen Regent, Mary of Guise. After her death, Mary Queen of Scots ascended to the throne, and her marriage to the Catholic Henry Stuart resulted in even greater discord. The Wars of Religion formally ended in Europe with the 1648 Peace of Westphalia.

Anglo-Spanish War
1585-1604
The Anglo-Spanish War was part of the European Wars of Religion. In 1585, England came to the aid of the Protestant Netherlands, who were attempting to resist the rule of Catholic Spain. Philip II, a Habsburg and bitter enemy of Elizabeth I, ordered an armada to invade England in 1588. Due to the fireship strategy of the English navy and severe storms in the North Atlantic, the Spanish armada suffered a crushing defeat. The conflicts--never officially declared a war--came to an end in 1604 with the treaty of London, in which James VI & I agreed to stop English privateering if the Spanish agreed to stop military operations in the Netherlands and Ireland.

Italian Wars
1494-1559
The Italian Wars were a conflict between various European states over territory across Western Europe. What began as a Spanish attempt to become a major power (at the expense of France) became a series of alliances and betrayals, often centered on the Pope’s allegiance to either side. Henry VII renewed the Treaty of Étaples with France in 1498, but in 1510, a year after Henry VIII became king, England changed course and joined the Holy League of Pope Julius II against France. This alliance was renewed when Henry sided with the new Pope, who had made peace with the Holy Roman Emperor Charles V, leaving France with no powerful allies. In 1526--several years before Henry VIII broke ties with the Catholic Church--England changed course again and joined the League of Cognac, an opposition against Charles V led by Pope Clement VII. The war ended with the Peace of Cateau-Cambrésis in 1559, a year after Elizabeth I took the English crown.

Anglo-Scottish Wars
1328-1603
The Anglo-Scottish Wars began with the  Scottish Wars of Independence in the mid-14th century and persisted for nearly 300 years. Although Henry VII and James IV made attempts at peace, Henry VIII severed these fragile ties during the “Rough Wooing” in the mid-16th century. This bloody conflict was an effort to weaken the alliance between Scotland and France, England’s longtime enemy, and a plot to force an Anglo-Scottish alliance through the marriage of Edward VI and Mary Queen of Scots. Conflict continued intermittently under Edward VI, Mary I, and Elizabeth I. The wars formally ended with the Union of the Crowns in 1603, when James VI & I (son of Mary Queen of Scots) ascended to the English throne, uniting England and Scotland under one ruler.

Gunpowder Plot
1605
The Gunpowder Plot was an attempted assassination of James VI & I by a group of English Catholics. The plot arose in response to James’ increasing religious intolerance. The group planned to blow up the House of Lords on the 5th of November, killing the king and Protestant MPs, leaving the throne vacant for James’ Catholic daughter. The famous Guy Fawkes was charged with handling the explosives, but he was arrested by the authorities after an anonymous tip-off. After a brief scuffle in which several of the rebels were killed, the survivors were arrested and sentenced to death.

Conquest of Ireland
1529-1603
The Conquest of Ireland was the subjugation of the Irish by Tudor England. After an anti-English rebellion in the 1520s, Henry VIII declared himself King of Ireland and traded protection of all Irish lords for allegiance to the English crown. Catholic Ireland resisted the imposition of Anglicanism, and after Henry died, insurrections broke out across the country. Both Mary I and Elizabeth I attempted to control Ireland through military occupation and the creation of Plantations, which were settled by Anglos who tried to spread English language, law, and culture. The conflict came to a head when powerful Irish lords rallied to break with the crown in the Nine Years’ War. After an English triumph, many of the lords fled, resulting in James VI & I exerting greater control over the country. British settlers rushed to fill the vacant seats of power, creating the Protestant Plantation of Ulster.
