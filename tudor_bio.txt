The Tudors ruled England from 1485 to 1603. The family rose to power after the Wars of the Roses, a conflict between the Lancasters and the Yorks. Henry VII, the first Tudor monarch and a Lancastrian ally, married Elizabeth of York to secure his claim to the throne. Henry’s son Henry VIII (and his descendants) went on to rule England, while Henry’s daughter Margaret Tudor married James IV, the Stuart king of Scotland. The English Tudors saw periods of tremendous economic, social, and religious upheaval, particularly under Henry VIII during his break with the Catholic Church. The ensuing English Reformation pitted Catholics and Protestants against one another, resulting in a rapid succession of monarchs until the 45-year reign of Elizabeth I. Elizabeth also faced conflicts with Spain, a powerful Catholic country, and her cousin Mary Queen of Scots, who she eventually executed for treason. The Tudor line ended in 1603, when James IV & I, the Stuart king of Scotland, became the ruler of both countries and of Ireland, colonized by the English in decades prior.
